These systemd unit files are for getting Plex running as a rootless container with Podman. For more info, read this [blog entry on how it works](https://myee111.github.io/posts/plex/). To use these files, clone this repository into `~/.config/containers/systemd/`.

```bash
cd ~/.config/containers/systemd/
git clone https://github.com/myee111/plex-rootless-podman-systemd-unit-files.git
```
